### About

A 2D shooter game, kill insect-like bug creatures, find a way out.
A child is being told a story by his mom about a kid who finds a cave and out of curiosity, he goes through it only to find himself in an opposite dimension without a way back.
The only way home is to fight the buggy creatures and find the portal that opens once in a while. Luckily you have a weapon. Find the Kid's way out.
